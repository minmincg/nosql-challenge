In this challenge we got a dataset from The UK Food Standards Agency that various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. We will evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles using pymongo 
to do this analysis.
